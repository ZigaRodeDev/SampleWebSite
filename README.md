WebIO - UI/UX Design

This project is a simple and learning project for Web development carrere. It is a HTML webpage showcasing the services of a company named WebIO. The page focuses on UI/UX Design and related services such as SEO, SEM, user research, and web copywriting.

File Structure
- index.html - The main HTML file (this file).
- styles.css - The external stylesheet (currently linked but not provided in the example).

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Inline CSS (with some potential for external styling in styles.css)

Features
- Company title and slogan
- List of services offered
- Description of the companyâ€™s offerings
- Simple contact button (currently non-functional)
-Form for user inquiries (Name, Mail, Question fields with a send button)

Usage
- This file can be opened directly in a browser to view the page. To customize or style the page further, you can update the linked styles.css file or improve the inline styles.

Issues
- The "Contact us" button is missing a functional href or onclick action.
- Currently, the form has no backend handling logic. Submissions won't be processed.
- The design relies entirely on inline styles, which is not recommended for scalable or maintainable projects.

Recommended Improvements
- Move styles into styles.css.
- Add form handling logic (e.g., connect to a backend or use a service like Formspree).
- Add proper navigation links or functional contact button.
- Apply semantic HTML elements where appropriate (e.g., use section, header, and footer).
- Preview

The page will display a black background with white text highlighting services offered by WebIO, along with a simple form and a call-to-action button.
